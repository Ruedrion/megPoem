      <div id="poem">
          <p>For my poems, written so young<br>
I’d not dreamed I was a poet,<br>
Like drops from the fountain flung,<br>
Like sparks from a rocket,<br><br>
That burst into the realm of true<br>
Sleep, and incense, like tiny demons,<br>
For my poems about death and youth,<br>
– For my unread sermons! –<br><br>
Scattered in dusty stores, in line,<br>
Where, un-purchased, they are dumb,<br>
For my poems, like precious wine,<br>
A time will come.</p>
